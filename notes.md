## Project Overview

* Computational software for single/multiple flow turbines
* Utilizes fictitious domain method for simulation
* Restricts movement of blades around rotational axis

## Notes

* Uses Julia for computational code
* Uses Qt5 for GUI windows

## Code Structure

1. Mesh creation from stl input (allow for saving of mesh)
1. Class for inputs to fluid solver
1. Fictitious domain class
1. Fluid Simulation class

## Development Plan

1. Learn how to use Julia
1. Develop fluid solver
1. Develop simulation input class
1. Fictitious domain class
1. GUI implementation to create class properties
