## Project Overview

* Computational software for single/multiple flow turbines
* Utilizes fictitious domain method for simulation
* Restricts movement of blades around rotational axis

## Notes

* Uses Python/Pyfoam for computational code
* Uses Qt5 for GUI windows

## Code Structure

* Mesh creation from stl input (allow for saving of mesh)
* Class for inputs to fluid solver
  * 
* Fictitious domain class
* Fluid Simulation class

## Development Plan

* Find fast stl reader (or develop my own)
* Create classes for relevant objects
* Figure out how to set up and run Pyfoam cases
